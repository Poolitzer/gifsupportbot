This bot is intended to give users support GIFs. Those should help in the talk groups, given that sometimes users don't 
speak english well and (moving) images say more then words. While most of the code runs in the background and is not 
interesting for anyone, the inline mode certainly is (because it is the way you encounter the bot) and the code itself 
may show some fellow developers what you can do with a telegram bot. Open Source, yay \o/

## Dependencies
You need to install the [python-telegram-bot library](https://python-telegram-bot.org/), the 
[pymongo library](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/) and [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/). 
That's it.
