This bot is intended to give users support GIFs. Those should help in the talk groups, given that sometimes users don't 
speak english well and (moving) images say more then words. While most of the code runs in the background and is not 
interesting for anyone, the inline mode certainly is (because it is the way you encounter the bot) and the code itself 
may show some fellow developers what you can do with a telegram bot. Open Source, yay \o/

## Dependencies
You need to install the [python-telegram-bot library](https://python-telegram-bot.org/), the 
[pymongo library](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/) and [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/). 
That's it.

A big thanks to a lot of people is due at this point. I'd really like to thank Dave, the creator of 
[Thesaurus](https://git.cinege.com/thesaurus/). Without his work, a fair amount of this project would have been significantly harder to implement. Also a big thanks to [Linus]("https://t.me/Linus), who helped discovering endless bugs.
